# desktop-timer
I'm always using youtube, google or my phone as a timer. I decided I'd make a simple timer app with a shortcut on my taskbar. I'm thinking about first making it very'lk simple, but eventually having the hours minutes and seconds as a scrolling wheel just like in Android on my phone.
